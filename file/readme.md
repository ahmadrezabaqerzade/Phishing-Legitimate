In this project we want to test different supervised models in machine learning and then we choose a one model,after that we preprocess the dataset by an extraction and selection methods on the model we chose.At the first we starting by testing the different models on the dataset.Our dataset contain a 49 feature that one last feature is a class label or target.At last we shall see that there are a few features but accuracy is still up.Reduction dimention can 
to reduce the expendable memory and help to running a model faster.
